      text: "I Joined BHIForex as a complete beginner in August 2023 during my holidays and in 2 months I started seeing impressive results. The classes are easy to understand. All the teachers in the academy always push me to be the best special thanks to Samuel Tochi. My favourite classes are the interactive classes with the community managers and the Wednesday live trading session with Jeffrey Benson. Have been able to help my friends pass their prop firm challenges and have investors waiting to invest in my trading portfolio. Thank you BHIForex Academy.",
